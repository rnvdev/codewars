- My CodeWars JavaScript challenge responses.
- My goal is study, learn and follow the best answer always as possible.
- Look that as a constantly progress. 
- Some challenges (**happy tree**, **anagram_checker** and **palindrome_checker**) are my self challenge (out of CodeWars). 
- 🚀 some challenges will be refactored in the future and will be identified with ***_v2*** in the end of file's name. 
- ⚠️ **Please don't use my solutions in your CodeWar, they are available only for study purpose.**
